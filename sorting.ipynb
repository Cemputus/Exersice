    "Here's an explanation of various sorting algorithms along with their respective time complexities:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insertion Sort**:\n",
    "   - Time Complexity:\n",
    "     - Worst-case: O(n^2)\n",
    "     - Best-case: O(n)\n",
    "   - Description: Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is efficient for small data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Heap Sort**:\n",
    "   - Time Complexity:\n",
    "     - Worst-case: O(n log n)\n",
    "     - Best-case: O(n log n)\n",
    "   - Description: Heap Sort is an in-place comparison-based sorting algorithm that works by dividing the input into a sorted and an unsorted region and iteratively shrinking the unsorted region.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Counting Sort**:\n",
    "   - Time Complexity:\n",
    "     - Worst-case: O(n + k) where k is the range of input values\n",
    "   - Description: Counting Sort is a non-comparison-based sorting algorithm that works for integers with a limited range of values. It counts the frequency of each value and reconstructs the sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comb Sort**:\n",
    "   - Time Complexity:\n",
    "     - Worst-case: O(n^2)\n",
    "     - Best-case: O(n log n)\n",
    "   - Description: Comb Sort is an improvement over Bubble Sort that eliminates small values at the end of the list efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bucket Sort**:\n",
    "   - Time Complexity:\n",
    "     - Worst-case: O(n^2) (if each bucket contains multiple values)\n",
    "     - Best-case: O(n + k) (if each value goes into a separate bucket)\n",
    "   - Description: Bucket Sort is a distribution-based sorting algorithm that divides the input into buckets and sorts each bucket individually, typically using another sorting algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Bubble Sort**:\n",
    "   - Time Complexity:\n",
    "     - Worst-case: O(n^2)\n",
    "     - Best-case: O(n)\n",
    "   - Description: Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Merge Sort**:\n",
    "   - Time Complexity:\n",
    "     - Worst-case: O(n log n)\n",
    "     - Best-case: O(n log n)\n",
    "   - Description: Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Quick Sort**:\n",
    "   - Time Complexity:\n",
    "     - Worst-case: O(n^2) (rare, can be mitigated with optimizations)\n",
    "     - Best-case: O(n log n)\n",
    "   - Description: Quick Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a \"pivot\" element and partitions the array into two sub-arrays, those less than the pivot and those greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the sub-arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Selection Sort**:\n",
    "   - Time Complexity:\n",
    "     - Worst-case: O(n^2)\n",
    "     - Best-case: O(n^2)\n",
    "   - Description: Selection Sort divides the input into a sorted and an unsorted region. In each iteration, it selects the minimum element from the unsorted region and swaps it with the first element in the unsorted region.\n",
    "\n",
    "These sorting algorithms have different characteristics and are suitable for different use cases. The choice of algorithm depends on the specific requirements of the sorting task and the constraints of the system or application."
